This dataset is the ***apple leaf disease dataset***, which was
collected in a real natural environment. Part of it is provided
by the CVPR 2021 challenge (Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8),
while the rest is obtained from local orchards and classified
by plant protection experts. It comprises 8,084 images in six
types, covering frogeye leaf spot, mosaic, powdery mildew,
rust, scab, and healthy leaves.
